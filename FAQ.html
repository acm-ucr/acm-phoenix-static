	ACM@UCR is a professional student organization focused on Computer Science 
	and Engineering. We help students develop the technical and communication skills 
	they need to get a job in industry. Our mission is to help students succeed in 
	getting the opportunity for an internship or a full time job by offering workshops 
	and events aimed towards that goal.
