Hey everyone, 

Excited to start the new school year!?!?! :D

We’ve been talking to the people at **HackerRank** and they’re giving us an opportunity to have our own mini-hackathon in the ACM clubroom with all of the essentials: **free energy drinks**, **food**, and **swag!** Also, you can get noticed and get **job/internship** offers from great companies like **Google** and **Facebook**!

All you have to do is signup for the [HackerRank Back2School CodeSprint](https://www.hackerrank.com/back2school14) and choose to represent University of California, Riverside.

**CodeSprint** is a **24 hour event** where each person takes on 7 programming challenges. These challenges rank from easy to expert in difficulty, but they are very fun to try taking a crack at! You can choose what **programming language** to use as well!

Bring your **laptop** and **blanket** if you plan on staying overnight! Register [now!](https://www.hackerrank.com/back2school14) so we get enough food/swag for everyone!
