### HackerRank Artificial Intelligence Competition
<i class="icon-calendar"></i> Jan 19, 2013 @ 12:00 PM

Hey everyone, I'm announcing a very awesome opportunity being offered to our club by the team at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/):
<blockquote>
HackerRank is kicking off the Spring semester with a Back to School Hackathon and the top ten will win a trip to Silicon Valley, meet VCs, tour tech companies and participate in a hackathon against the top 10 finishers. This will be an artificial intelligence challenge that will last for 12 hours.
</blockquote>

For all you members looking for internship opportunities and a cool project to put on your resume, this is a great chance to get some interesting experience regardless of class level. HackerRank is a social site for hackers that has relationships with Facebook, Quora, Amazon, Pocket Gems, Evernote, Palintir and many other high-visibility companies. Doing well in this competition would definitely be a great foot in the door for future jobs.

If that's not enough motivation to participate in this, let's take a look at the prizes. As mentioned above, the top ten will win a trip to Silicon Valley and meet with popular Venture Capital companies as well as tour software engineering companies. But that's not all. First place wins $2000 and gets to meet with partners of the popular starter backer, YCombinator. Second place wins $1000, third place wins $500, fourth wins $250, and fifth wins $125.

I'd really love to see some ACM participation in this event. You'll be competing with many colleges around the world and there will be some major bragging rights for the winner. Also, you'll get to test the extent of your knowledge and learn a lot. If you are interested in participating in this, please register for the competition [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/back2school). Other than that, good luck everyone. I'm sure you can rank high!
