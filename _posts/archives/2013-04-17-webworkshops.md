Hey everyone,

The ACM@UCR Website development workshop, "How do I shot website," is up and running, so I just want to share the details and appropriate links in a central location.

Currently, the workshops are being held on Wednesdays from 2-3pm and on Fridays from 6-7pm. The meeting location schedule is the following (this includes the previous meetings as well):

<table class="table">

This schedule is tentative, but what we'll go with for now.

Also, if you want to find the previous slides and videos, you will be able to find them (eventually) here: <a href="http://acm-ucr.github.io/">http://acm-ucr.github.io/</a>. Currently, the second and third videos are being processed and will be up soon.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Chris
