Hey everyone,

Don't forget to come to our final general meeting for this quarter! We'll be discussing the upcoming Lan Party (March 8th), the upcoming Chess Tournament and Website Workshop, and debriefing on the Programming Competition and E-Week.

We'll also be talking about new officer elections. We want to do elections in either the first or second general meeting of next quarter, so if you're interested in taking any of these positions, please start to speak up now!

And finally, don't forget that the ACM T-Shirt designs are due this Monday. So, if you've been working on one and want to turn it in, please email us at acm.at.ucr@gmail.com

See you then!
