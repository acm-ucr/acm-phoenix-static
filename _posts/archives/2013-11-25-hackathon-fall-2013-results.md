<p>
Team get_stuff_done from left to right: <em>Manny Sanchez, Tina Wang, Benjamin Kellogg, and Matthew Underwood</em>
</p>
<p>
The winning team made a website for collaborative whiteboarding. Very much like in concept to google docs, their website allows multiple users to draw on the same whiteboard at the same time! </p>
<p>
I was purely amazed at the turnout for the hackathon! There were <em>EIGHT</em> teams that showed a final product at the end. Most teams made games while other teams made practical products. All in all, it was an impressive display of both teamwork and willingness to learn new technologies!
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of teams either did not have full functionality or were unable to show a complete product. I hope that you guys will continue onward and finish what you started.

<p>
There was a lot of Facebook swag that was distributed. 1st place winners took home: 2 Facebook bags + 1 Facebook Sweater + 1 Facebook Umbrella. 2nd Place winners got: 2 Facebook Sweaters, while 3rd place got a Facebook umbrella! Then everyone got participation prizes including Facebook stickers and Facebook "like" magnets!

<p>
As this event was such a success, we'll definitely contact <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> to see if they'll sponsor our next Hackathon. In case you didn't attend our <a href="http://slid.es/acmucr/acm-4th-general-meeting-fall-2013">last general meeting</a>, ESRI has indicated interest in sponsoring a hackathon next quarter using their SDK if the hackathon this quarter was a success.

<p>
Again, congratulations to Team get_stuff_done!
