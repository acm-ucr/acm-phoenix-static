Hey everyone,

Brandon and David quizzed me the other day about exactly what officers do in ACM other than lounge around and tell bad jokes, so I think it's pretty certain that others have similar questions. That's my bad, as one of my goals was to make the officers' duties pretty transparent. Maybe there isn't a particularly good platform for doing that in ACM currently, but that's a different discussion.

Anyways, let's get to the point. Most of the officers are either graduating or moving on to other things for next year. So we need people who really care about the state of this crazy club to replace them and keep us running semi-smoothly. Well, that's a little bit hard to do if you have no idea what we do, right? If you want a better idea about what we were really trying to do with the club, you should refer to our OKRs. We only gave you a cute little snippet of them in our first, so here's the actual full versions:

### Officer OKRs

6. [Membership Coordinator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VapIyUUTRjOcVl8W4q70HoRGa6ICeDXxp1vymZeFGeg/edit)
7. [Webmaster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KvYRYY6UvSpiW77bJGCZzzhiopyfwJN6btJCBBvsR8c/edit)

### The current situation

Let's preface with who is not going to be an officer next year: Justin Kahal (Vice Chair), John Sullivan (Treasurer), Ben Kellogg (Membership Coordinator), and myself (Chair & Webmaster). Also, whether or not Christine Hawley (Secretary) and Tina Wang (Historian) plan to reapply for the position depends on them. So, at the very least, we're going to need replacements for 5 positions (webmaster isn't necessary as it's own position). That's a lot of replacements so that's why we want to find out who's interested so we can elect and train the new officers as soon as possible.

### The nitty gritty

"Ok, that sounds kind of scary, but what do you all actually do?" Well, let's see:

TL;DR: Here's detailed descriptions of what we do. Please find something you like and nominate yourself or someone else.

#### Chair

As Chair, my job is to manage all of our assets and build relationships with the different BCOE organizations in order to secure the present and future growth of ACM. I'm concerned with making sure everyone is getting something out of ACM other than an headache and I try to delegate all of the work that implies to the other officers, as well as making final decisions when there are alternatives. I'm just a figurehead, though, and all the real work gets done by

#### Vice Chair

As Vice Chair, Justin's job is to, as he put it, "[a]ssure political, economical, social, and physical stability in the club." He's the one who will randomly strike up a conversation with you to find out what you're up to and what your preferences are so we can have awesome social events. This is really helpful as it allows us to be able to keep members relatively happy. He also makes sure that the club itself doesn't fall apart, either through being trashed or being broke, by regularly organizing events like lab cleanups and fundraisers. At the same time, he manages the other officers to make sure that we all work together and acts as my stand-in.

#### Secretary

As Secretary, Christine's job is to connect us officers to our members and other BCOE students by acting as a liaison. She's the one reminding everyone of events happening in the future like this week's Lan Party and the General Meeting earlier this week. She'll try to sit in on other clubs' meetings to find out what they're up so we can keep up to date and confirm the details of everything. She takes a ton of notes at the meetings to make sure we keep on track with the things we promised we do and keeps everything in working condition.

#### Treasurer

As Treasurer, John's job is to worry about the actual details of keeping ACM funded and sustainable for the future. He manages all of the club's funding by keeping a detailed treasurer's report of all club purchases made and reimbursements received. He also manages the club refrigerator fund, making it clear to members how much money is needed for the next refill and when he plans to refill it. Without John, we wouldn't have midnight fuel for that programming assignment we started on the day it was due. He also approves any funding we might need for events we'd like to hold. Basically, his job is to smack some sense into us the next time we offer $300 in Google Store prizes at a programming competition or spend $200 on hardly used club jerseys.

#### Historian

As Historian, Tina's job is to meticulously record what goes on throughout the entire year. This is really helpful because it is really impossible to see the future when you don't know what you've already done. We are able to use these records to look for ways to improve on our events and make sure we never forget anything. At the same time, she might as well be our second secretary. She also does a lot of the detailed work that actually keeps things in working condition such as showing up to necessary events and doing basically all the work.

#### Membership Coordinator

As Membership Coordinator, Ben's job is to reach out to the BCOE community and beyond to help us hold events that will get us a chance to gain more members and bond with the active ones better. For example, Ben is the one who corresponds with Steam to try to get us keys to no avail and regularly helps out at tabling events to talk about the club. He also helps out a lot with organizing the meetings to make sure everything goes smoothly and all members are accounted for.

#### Webmaster

As webmaster, my job is to keep ACM@UCR's web presence up-to-date and try to make the website easy to develop and extend for club purposes. This involves creating whatever necessary tools and tutorials seem appropriate at the time. [ACM@UCR has a Github account](https://github.com/acm-ucr) dedicated to these kinds of things if you didn't notice the link at the bottom.

And that's about it. If you managed to get this far and one of these positions interests you or you think you can just do better than us, please get in contact with us so we can nominate you for these positions. The future of ACM rests in your palms.
