##Raytheon has exclusively invited ACM@UCR to participate in their online chats with recruiters!


Hey everyone, I just wanted to pass along some information about some job opportunities (fulltime and intern positions) being offered by Raytheon.

Over the next few weeks they are going to be having a series of online chats with recruiters to talk about job opportunities in the military contracting field. Qualified candidates must be pursuing a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in engineering, cyber, math, physics, finance, accounting, business, supply chain, or IT.

I recommend you seriously consider this opportunity to work at a nice government job.
