About a month ago, on November 10th, a group of ACM members, including myself, participated in the Southern California International Collegiate Programming Competition hosted at Riverside Community College. This is a yearly algorithm competition that we try to go to every year unless there is something that prohibits us.

This year, our teams consisted of ACM members with a varying range of algorithmic knowledge including Freshman through Senior level students, some without prior programming experience. Regardless of that, our teams performed very well against what was some very intimidating competition: 70 teams including favorites from Harvey Mudd, Caltech, and USC.

Overall, our teams, Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael, ranked between 20th and 53rd place against the 70 other teams. We were actually ranked higher than that after the competition ended, but there was recently a re-scoring of one of the problems due to some judging error that knocked our ranks down slightly.

You can see the official competition standings [here](http://www.socalcontest.org/history/2012/results-2012.shtml), but I'll break it down for you all:
<ul>
<li>Team Raphael (Benjamin Kellogg, Chris Mueller, Gabriel Limon) stands in 20th place, solving 4 problems with 0 penalties and a time of 11:37:09.</li>
<li>Team Donatello (Armando Gonzalez, Ferris Nehme, Jordan Schuetz) stands in 22nd place, solving 3 problems with 1 penalty and a time of 4:03:19.</li>
<li>Team Leonardo (Hua Hsin, Miguel Martinez, Rudresh Amin) stands in 41st place, solving 2 problems with 0 penalties and a time of 3:29:15.</li>
<li>Team Michelangelo (Randy Truong, Manuel Sanchez) stands in 53rd place, solving 2 problems with 2 penalties and a time of 6:21:46.</li>
</ul>

I'm really proud of the performance of this group, especially the non-seniors. They have some real potential to score very well if they choose to participate in the future. So, if you see these guys around ACM, you know who is going to beat you in our local programming competitions that are coming up. Also, give them a pat on the back for their performance.

P.S. The problem set from the competition is posted [here](http://www.socalcontest.org/history/2012/socal2012.pdf) if you want to see how well you can do against these problems. I believe you can submit them to check your solution on the [UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/).
