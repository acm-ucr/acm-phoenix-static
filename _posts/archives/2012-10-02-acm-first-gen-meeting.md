Hey everyone, I want to make an official blog post to alert everyone that

## ACM's First General Meeting is this Friday, Oct. 5, from 5:30 - 6:30pm in CHUNG 205/6

If you don't know where this room is, please feel free to stop by the ACM Club room in **CHUNG 226** to ask us. Long story short, it will be in the conference rooms right across the patio.

See you then!
