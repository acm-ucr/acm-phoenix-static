Hey Guys!  I just wanted to share something I got in my email the other day.  <b>Apparently Intel is hosting a US Student Virtual Career Fair this Wednesday, October 17, 2012 from 11am PST - 1pm PST for College Graduates and Interns!</b>

Although this is more for students who are either graduates or going to graduate soon I still think it's a good idea to maybe take a look at it if you have any interest in working with Intel.  Here is the email I got:
