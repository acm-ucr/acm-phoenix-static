I'd like to announce that the development version of the ACM@UCR website has been released. You can check it out on [github](https://github.com/acm-ucr/acm-phoenix).

###So what does this mean for me?
Well, if you were ever interested in web development and design, we're looking for contributors, regardless of skill level. The more interest you show, the more information we'll post about it and the more workshops/tech talks we'll schedule about web development. Also, we're willing to work together with you to show the ropes of "modern" techniques used in web design and development. This also means that our club portal will improve until it has all the functionality you all need. So seriously, if you're looking for a fun little project to gnaw your teeth on, I recommend you take a look at the code and see where you can fit in.

If you're interested in seeing workshops and tech talks focusing on web development in the future, please email the [ACM Webmaster](mailto:acm.at.ucr+webmaster@gmail.com).

Thanks, and we hope to see your contributions in the future.
