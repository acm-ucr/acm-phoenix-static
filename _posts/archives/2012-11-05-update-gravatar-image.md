## Please upload your preferred profile image to Gravatar

Hey everyone, you might have noticed that I added a new page, [About us](/about/). On that page there's a nice little display of who we are that pulls all of your gravatar profiles to showcase the membership. So if you could, it would be nice if you could update your gravatar image or link it to your registered email.

If you're not sure how to do that, head over to <http://www.gravatar.com> and follow the simple instructions. If you still have questions, email me at <a href="mailto:acm.at.ucr+webmaster@gmail.com">acm.at.ucr+webmaster@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!
