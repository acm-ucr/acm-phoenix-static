Hey everyone,

I wanted to officially congratulate the new ACM Officers for next year on their positions. So congrats to:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Officer Position</th>
    <th>Officer Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Chair</td>
      <td>Miguel Martinez</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Vice Chair</td><td>Brandon Huyhn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Secretary</td><td>Christine Hawley</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Treasurer</td><td>Samuel Hong</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Historian</td><td>Elias Bravo</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Membership Coordinator</td><td>Fernando Gonzalez</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Webmaster</td><td>John Sullivan</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Hopefully they'll be able to make improvements in the places where I and the previous generation of officers failed. Please treat them kindly.
