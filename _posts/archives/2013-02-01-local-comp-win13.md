Hey everyone, join us in the ACM Clubroom (WCH 226) for our local programming competition this winter. It will be held on Week 7 (same week as E-Week) from Noon to 5PM, tentatively.

So far, the supported languages are going to be C/C++ and Java. We will have Professors Marek Chrobak and Neal Young choosing and explaining the problem set with assistance from graduate student Li Yan. There will also be a nice set of prizes to reward those who reach the top 3-5 ranks and food provided to fuel your programming.

This event is open to everyone so if you or someone you know is interested, please email the ACM Chair at <a href="mailto:acm.at.ucr+chair@gmail.com">acm.at.ucr+chair@gmail.com</a>. We are currently looking for more teams to register, so when you email us, make sure you specify the other team members you want or that you are looking for a team or that you want to be a team of one. Teams can be up to 3 people. See you there!
