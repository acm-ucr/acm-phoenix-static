### Microsoft Tech Talk on Human Computation this Tuesday 10/23 @ WCH 205/6

Hey everyone, Microsoft is going to be here on Tuesday and they're inviting all PhD, Masters and Undergraduate students in the fields of CS, CE, EE, and ME to come and join them.

The guest speaker, Omar Alonso will speaking about Human Computation, which is more colloquially known as Crowdsourcing. You can read more about that [here](http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/crowd/)(warning: kind of wordy). Crowdsourcing, essentially, is the process of generating content based on the wisdom of the crowd of users. Think Wikipedia or Reddit.

Regardless, Mr. Alonso is very well-versed in this subject and has written many papers on it so I recommend you all come and enjoy the tech talk. Also, there will be free food! If you want to see the official flyer, you can view it [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B402O9Hu6p3KWFFqMzh5SGxvbDA).

Make sure you RSVP for this event so the Microsoft Representatives know how much swag to bring. The process of RSVPing, from Jun's email:
<blockquote>

I hope all of you guys can make it!
