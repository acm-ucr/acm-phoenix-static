###General news about upcoming programming competitions

First of all, I'd like to talk about the ICPC programming competition sponsored by IBM that is coming up on November 10th. We don't actually have the official teams formed yet except for speculation so if you are interested in participating, please email us at <acm.at.ucr@gmail.com> announcing your interest in this competition. We have a good amount of open spots, so it will be first come first serve for the most part. The deadline to sign up the official teams is this Saturday so it will be official by then.

Don't worry if you don't get in on the ICPC team, however, because this year we plan to have a lot more local programming competitions. We're currently in the process of setting up training sessions and weekly problems with Professor Neal Young, who teaches algorithms, and Li Yan, a graduate student with lots of experience with programming competitions and algorithms.

Yet again, this is open for students of all skill levels. Strengthening your algorithmic approach to Computer Science problems will also help you in interviews and general programming applications. So I recommend that even if you don't know anything about algorithms, you still try to think about the practice problems we'll be giving on a semi-regular basis.

For the programming competitions we'll be participating in, the allowed languages will be C, C++, and Java.
