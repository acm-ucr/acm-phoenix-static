ACM@UCR has been upgraded!
===========================

Hello all returning and potential members, I'd like to announce the official release of the new ACM@UCR website! Hopefully, it is aesthetically pleasing and fluid to navigate while also growing in its usefulness in your CS life while at UCR.

ACM serves primarily as a well of knowledge about Computer Science and the underlying culture but until now, much of that knowledge has been tribal knowledge that varies depending on who you ask. We'd like to improve the method by which that  knowledge is transferred to the next generation of students. My focus when creating this site was to make it easy for regular members to find content and for publishers and administrators to generate it. With this, we can move away from the more traditional style of waiting for the Webmaster to post information and move closer to the modern approach of crowdsourcing knowledge, whether it be lessons learned from the degree pursuit or interesting tidbits about best practices in developments.

With that being said, let me introduce you to some new site features:

> ### Login with R'Mail
I don't know about you, but I hate having to come up with a new password for every website I visit while I simultaneously fear that the web developers are storing my password in plain text and sending post cards of it to hackers in Alaska. Connecting should be simple and only a few button clicks away. By using the [Google OAuth2.0 API](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2), you are now able to connect to the ACM site using your R'Mail account. If you're already signed in, it's just one button click away. However, **make sure you [register to be a member](/register) with your R'Mail address** before trying to take advantage of this system.

> ### <i class="icon-leaf"></i> Purely on-line membership registration
Paperwork is a mess. Period. It tends to get lost, shredded, and when you need it the most, you don't know who to go to for help or what to do. To circumvent this and make it easier on you, we implemented a purely on-line version of our old membership registration form. You can even make your membership payments electronically using [WePay](https://wepay.com). Of course, if you don't feel comfortable doing this, you can still fallback to the old version, but we'd like to encourage you to try it out. But seriously, it's pretty cool. You can generate a signature from your full name or draw one using your sketchpad. You can also customize your description with [Github Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)!

> ### Article Database
Forgot something we mentioned? Saw something interesting in our blog posts once? It should be easy to retrieve using the article database that comes with nice filtering tools for fine-tuning your queries.

> ### User Profile Images powered by [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)
Add a little more personality to your profile with your Gravatar. We use your provided email to find your Gravatar image so we know who you are. You can see mine on the top right of this post.

> ### Article and User Administration tools
For those with publishing and administrator privileges, there are easy to use tools that will allow you to create and edit user account information and posted articles. This means that updates to the site will become more common and natural, which will lead to happy users and improved content.


And that's about all for now. In the future, the website's source code will be released on [Github](https://github.com), which means all of you that absolutely hate it can contribute to its betterment in the future. Anyways, thanks for reading through the first blog post of hopefully many. Keep in touch,
