<dd>Location: WCH 202</dd>

</dl>

Hopefully you can all make it and please bring any questions you have for us to try to answer. One thing to note is that we are not allowed to help you with programming assignments at this session. This will be covering topics and materials gone over in class. We can discuss previous programming assignments, but not current ones. If you have any questions or noticed something I missed, please feel free to email me @ <a href="mailto:acm.at.ucr@gmail.com">acm.at.ucr@gmail.com</a>.
