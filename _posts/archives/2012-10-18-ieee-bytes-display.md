###IEEE Needs Programmers for their new Nine Screen Display in Bytes

Right now the details are bit fuzzy, but IEEE is doing a pretty cool project in Bytes. They are putting up a nine monitor display that people can interact with. They have all of the hardware set up and now they just need some developers to implement something interesting to interact with. Maybe a game or some type of touch screen service. At any rate, I'd really like to see some ACM participation in this. This is a great opportunity to work with future EE professionals and form a nice network.

Some other details that may or may not be true are that they are primarily looking for C++ programmers and that you might able to get access to a XBOX Kinect to do motion detection. If that is true, we could see some really interesting projects.

I recommend you guys at least check it out. If you're interested, you can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ucr.edu/spreadsheet/viewform?om=true&richtext=false&formkey=dEkwc0tvejZzcjJtR2J4S1pUQ2hUSFE6MQ#gid=0). If you still feel like you don't know what's going on, I'd recommend visiting the Solarium in WCH 221 and asking one of the officers there.

I'll be sure to post an update as more information becomes available.
