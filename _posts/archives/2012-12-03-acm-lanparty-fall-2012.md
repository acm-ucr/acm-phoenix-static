First of all, I want to thank everyone who helped out with and was able to attend the ACM@UCR Fall 2012 Lan Party this previous Saturday, November 30th. In particular, I need to thank <b>Victor Hill</b> and <b>Grant Brady</b> who pulled a lot of their resources and time to help set up the machines to be able to run Steam in such a short amount of time. They're definitely the heroes in all this. If you see them around, repeat verbatim: "Good job and get some sleep!"

At the same time, thank you to everyone who showed up and kicked off the event. All the planning in the world means nothing if no one shows up to your events, right? Although we never did get Steam keys (*shaking fist at Valve*), I hope everyone that attended had a lot of fun and got some stress out before the final stretch.

So good news for anyone interested, we plan to try to get one of these together every quarter! I'll do a better job of advertising this time, I swear! 

In all seriousness, my apologies to those who were unclear about the details or unaware of the existence of the event. Since the turn-out was really great and the participation was spectacular (it was still going on strong at 11pm that night), we will definitely up our efforts to make sure everyone can come and have fun.

Meanwhile, I'm driving to Gabe Newell's house right now to beg him for Steam keys for next and/or teach him to count to 3. Good luck on your finals!
