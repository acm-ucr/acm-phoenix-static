Hey guys!

Just recently, we had our HackerRank Codesprint event! Thank you for participating! Also, if you havenâ€™t seen our slides yet from our third general meeting, then check them out [here!](http://slides.com/acmucr/second-general-meeting-30-31#/) Also, we will be having our fourth general meeting, which we will be holding our officer elections at this time!

Pick in mind who you believe would be suited to be one of the following outstanding leaders in the form. Remember, each and every position is vital for making ACM grow into a professional and welcoming club. Each position requires your time commitment for each week. If you wish to know more in depth about these time commitments, then check out the [officers](http://acm.cs.ucr.edu/officers.html) webpage and send us an email if you want to know more.

Those who have been nominated will receive an email by **Friday, 2/13/15,11:59PM**. There will be subsequent updates for those who are nominated. On the day of elections, you can choose to nominate yourself.
