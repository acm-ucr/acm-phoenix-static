Hello guys!

On Wednesday, Oct. 8th, 2014, from 4:00PM to 5:00PM, we had our first general meeting! Thank you for listening to us in our meeting and for participating in our boba drink social, **"Meet and Greet!"** We hope to see you at our next meetings so that we can help you get more involved and/or develop the skills you need to get internships or full-time jobs!

For those who attended our first general meeting, you will find our link to the survey that was handed out during that meeting right below! There are additional questions added so that this can further help us gather your opinions to improve your experience with future meetings.

We also understand that there were still many interested people who could not attend our meeting. Follow the link below to find our slides that we used during our presentation.

To navigate through the slides, you should see a blue directional arrow pointing the right with other faded arrows pointing up, left, and down on the bottom right corner of the page. As you go to the next slide by clicking on the right directional arrow, then you should see the faded blue down arrow become a nice blue arrow to see more slides related to a specific topic.

We will update you about our upcoming events as soon as possible! Feel free to follow us in the links below!
